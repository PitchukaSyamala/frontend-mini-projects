React.js

Axios (for HTTP requests)

Pok√©API (for data)

üß† How It Works (Code Explanation)
useState is used to track:

num: The selected Pok√©mon number.

name: The name of the Pok√©mon.

moves: The total number of moves the Pok√©mon can perform.

useEffect runs every time the component renders, fetching data from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${num} based on the selected number.

The <select> dropdown allows you to choose a number between 1 and 10.

Upon selection, it fetches:

The name of the Pok√©mon.

The number of moves.

These are then displayed in the UI using <h1> elements, with the selected data highlighted in red.
